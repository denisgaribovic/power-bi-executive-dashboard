# 📊 Superstore Executive Dashboard – Power BI Self-Service Analytics

This project showcases an interactive **self-service Power BI dashboard** built using the [Superstore dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final), a popular retail dataset containing sales, profit, quantity, customer, and order-level information across multiple US regions. 

It is designed to empower business stakeholders with **instant insights** into key performance metrics, while also enabling **deep dives** into individual orders to identify growth and optimization opportunities.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This dashboard simulates an executive-level reporting tool for a retail company, enabling users to explore:

- **High-level KPIs**: Customers, Orders, Quantity, and Profit  
- **Trends over time**: Monthly breakdowns for all key metrics  
- **Flexible filtering**: By Region, State, City, Segment, Product, Ship Mode, Order ID, and Date Range  
- **Order-level exploration**: Drill-down capability to inspect individual orders and surface the most profitable ones  

## 🎯 Business Needs Addressed
